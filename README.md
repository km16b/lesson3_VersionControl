## Project Description:
In this assignment, I had to create my own Github account and connect it to my Cloud9 account. This way I can store my files in both a local and remote repository. After creating my Github account, I went back into my Cloud9 workspace and briefly discussed 5 key concepts I learned from the reading assignments. I also added pictures for each concept, as well as a header to tie my design together.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version Control is a repository system that organizes project files one may have that can be edited by many people such as team members working on one project. Benefits using a version control system include files cannot be overwritten and there is a common repository that can hold all of the latest files.
2. Every company will have someway to back up and save files because data is money. If you lose data then you lose money! Once you snapshot data, the versioning control system automatically notes all of the meta data, such as who changed the files, when they were changed, what changed about those files, and any merge changes to that same file.
3. Cloning can allow one to make a copy of someone's files and put it onto one's local repository where one can then edit and alter that specifc file.
