            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is merely a main repository system that organizes project files one may have over a long period of time. These files can be edited by many people such as team members working on one project. After multiple edits and alterations to a file, this version control system can revert the file back as many times needed, even back to its original state. This also means that using a version control system can help you recover files faster if they were to become messed up or even lost. With version control, file sharing is not an issue, and a file cannot be overwritten.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are different types of version control systems depending on what is needed. Local VCSs have a straightforward database where any change in the file is kept under a single correction control. A centralized VCS is used when one developer desires to work with other developers on one single file. In this case, one distinct  server contains every file so it can be accessed on multiple computers. A distributed VCS is where every developer maintains a copy of the data that is stored on their own machines. This way, if the server were to shut down, one can still access the files locally from one’s computer and work on it that way.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and unique example of a distributed version control system. It is an efficient way to manage files and store specific information locally and on certain servers. While the files are located on servers, they are also available on a developer’s local device. Collaboration is quick and time efficient because while one does have the opportunity to work on the server, if the server were to shut down or die, all work is still backed up locally on their machine. One then can use their locally stored file and load it back up to the server once it works again.</p>

                <span class="text-muted"> Three States of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The three main states that files can reside in are the committed state, the modified state, and the staged state. If a file is in a committed state, it just means that all of the data one has created is secure in a local database system. Once a file is in the modified state, the file has been altered in some way, however it is not committed to a database anymore. If the file is in the staged state, the file was recently modified and is getting ready to go to the committed state. In Git, one first modifies files, stages files, and finally commits those files and storing them in the Git directory.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Basic Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many git commands one may use in order to place files where they need to be. However, the three most basic Git commands happen to be add, commit, and push. $ git add . adds all files from one’s working area to the staging area. In other words, it takes one’s files and puts them in a holding place, such as a shopping cart. $ git commit -m ‘’ commits these files and places them into one’s local repository. $ git push will then copy the files located in the local repository and push them into a remote repository. One may also clone a file which allows one to make a copy of someone’s files and place it into a local repository. </p>
